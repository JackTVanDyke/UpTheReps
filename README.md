# UpTheReps
Helps you up the reps week over week.

UpTheReps tracks your workouts over time, showing insights such as total reps lifted, total weight lifted, and WoW/MoM increases in weight/reps. 

UpTheReps is built with Spring Boot and React with Typescript. (ESLint and Prettier are nice).

I used these technologies because I wanted to. I love React but I'm a little more indifferent about the backend. Spring Boot, Hibernate, and MySQL allowed for easy setup of my database and relationships amongst entities. The opinionated, boilerplate code of Spring Boot makes it rather starightforward to work with which is good for backends in my very limited experience and knowledge (so you should probably ignore my opinion).

In the future, I'll be finishing the project. I'd list specifics but there's a zero percent chance I update this README.md... ever. 

Oh, I would like to make this in React Native for people to use on their mobile devices. 

I'll post the link to UpTheReps here once it's finished and hosted.

I'd like to thank me, myself, and I for contributing to this project.
